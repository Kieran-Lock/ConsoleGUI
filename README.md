<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

ConsoleGUI is a lightweight GUI framework for compatible xterm terminals, allowing you to write complex terminal applications, with expressive, concise, and readable code.  
With zero external dependencies, and features including keyboard and mouse input, customizable event listeners, and multiple layer management, you can create and manage complex terminal GUIs with minimal overhead, all in Python.
